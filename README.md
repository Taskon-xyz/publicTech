# TaskOn WhiteLabel Solution - Technical Documentation

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains the complete technical documentation for TaskOn's WhiteLabel solution, designed to enable seamless integration of TaskOn's community and reward features into partner websites through iframe embedding with silent login capabilities.

## ðŸŽ¯ Background & Requirements

### Core Business Requirements
The WhiteLabel solution addresses the need for partners to integrate TaskOn functionality while maintaining their brand identity and user experience:

- **Silent Login**: Users logged into partner websites automatically access TaskOn features without re-authentication
- **Transparent Authorization**: All authorization operations occur under partner domains without redirects
- **Automatic Community Joining**: Users automatically join corresponding TaskOn communities when accessing through partner sites
- **Brand Consistency**: TaskOn features appear as native partner functionality through customizable theming

### Key Technical Challenges

#### 1. Cross-Domain Authentication
- **Challenge**: iframe-embedded TaskOn cannot access partner authentication tokens due to browser security restrictions
- **Solution**: Dual token mechanism (Primary Token + Shadow Token) with server-side mapping

#### 2. Wallet Integration in iframe Context  
- **Challenge**: Wallet plugins (MetaMask, etc.) only inject into top-level windows, not iframes
- **Solution**: Wallet Proxy Pattern using postMessage communication

#### 3. Security & Asset Protection
- **Challenge**: Existing TaskOn users accessing through partner sites may have historical assets that need protection
- **Solution**: Multi-factor verification for sensitive operations based on user classification

#### 4. System Compatibility
- **Challenge**: Minimize changes to existing TaskOn architecture while adding WhiteLabel capabilities
- **Solution**: Middleware-based architecture with configuration-driven customization
